My app makes it easy to search for breweries based on brewery type, city, state, and name. It also features a "My List" that allows users to make their own list of breweries just by checking the box under the brewery of their choice. The saved breweries are then stored in the my list page for future reference. It also uses pagination along with hooks method usehistory in order to make different pages for results based on the number of results.

This app uses Javascript, css, React. the API used is https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ which is open brewery db.
